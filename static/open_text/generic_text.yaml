  short_bio: "I am a Scientist and Python developer with over four years of programming and three years of molecular biology experience.
   My expertise are in fields of computational biology, early drug discovery, biomarker discovery, and high throughput data analysis, knowledge-base creation.
   I have extensive experience in NGS data handling / analysis, biological data handling, writing python packages, 
   working in CI/CD environments, git and relational database creation and experience in UNIX Shell scripting. 
   Along with significant programming experience I have also extensive wet lab experience which makes me an ideal 
   candidate for communicating with biologists and chemists as well as development team"
